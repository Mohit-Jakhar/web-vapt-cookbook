## Phase 3: Weaponization – Overview

What Happens in This Phase?

In this phase, the attacker takes the information gathered during **reconnaissance** and **scanning**, and builds **custom payloads or exploits** tailored to the target. The goal is to prepare the exact **attack vectors**, **scripts**, or **exploit chains** that will be used for exploitation in the next phase.

This phase is about **strategy and precision**, not just launching random attacks.

| Activity                        | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Payload crafting                | Creating custom payloads (e.g., SQLi strings, XSS scripts, SSRF chains)     |
| Encoding & obfuscation          | Bypassing filters using URL encoding, Base64, Unicode, etc.                 |
| Preparing shellcode             | Encoding or modifying reverse shell code for delivery                       |
| Client-side delivery setup      | Generating malicious links/files for phishing, XSS, or file upload attacks |
| Automation chaining             | Writing scripts or exploits to automate multi-step attacks                  |
| Bypassing security filters      | Crafting payloads that evade WAFs, IDS/IPS, and input validation            |

**Objective**

Develop tailored payloads or attack strategies that will exploit discovered vulnerabilities in the next phase.

**Real-World Analogy**

 Weaponization is like loading your rifle **after spotting the enemy base**. You’re choosing the right ammo (payload), tuning the scope (bypasses), and getting ready to pull the trigger (exploit).
