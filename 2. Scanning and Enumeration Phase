🔍 Phase 2: Scanning & Enumeration

🎯 Objective

To actively scan the target for open ports, services, directories, parameters, and possible vulnerabilities. This phase is crucial for mapping the real attack surface and identifying exploitable components.

🔎 What Happens in This Phase?

| Category                | Description                                              |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Port Scanning           | Identify open TCP/UDP ports and services                 |
| Service Enumeration     | Detect versions of services like Apache, MySQL, etc.     |
| Directory Brute Force   | Find hidden folders like `/admin`, `/uploads`, etc.      |
| Parameter Enumeration   | Find GET/POST parameters, cookies, etc.                  |
| Vulnerability Scanning  | Automated scanning for known CVEs or weaknesses          |


🧠 Key Concepts

- Enumeration helps in identifying assets like login panels, file uploads, or APIs.
- Scanning helps detect known misconfigurations or unpatched services.
- It's often noisy — requires proper authorization in professional assessments.
